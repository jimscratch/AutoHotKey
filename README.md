<h1>AutoHotKey</h1>
my scripts include compiled stuff
I'm using it to "fix" several of the more-annoying Windows7 vs old-school Windows-xp (which I like).

one thing is hooking Win+number keys and Win+P which can not be hooked using standard methods of old-school WinKey.

another thing is disabling several of IBM/Lenovo page left/page right which is above the left/right keys and will often cause problems especially on web-browsing, I've put it input standard left/right.

another thing is fixing ctrl+backspace to be compatible with everything by replacing the standard imp. with ctrl+left,ctrl+delete which will work on chrome and even cygwin!

disabling the ctrl+z combination which is unclear of which action it does in windows 7.


at some point in the past,
I've figured that to change the icon I should change the pre-compiled "bin" before compiling the ahk script,
but soon after that I've also come to the conclusion that it really won't matter... :/
